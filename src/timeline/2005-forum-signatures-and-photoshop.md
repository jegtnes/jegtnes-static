title: RuneScape, Forum Signatures & Photoshop

Tweenage Alex hears about this cool new _online_ computer game, RuneScape, and starts visiting his friends with a dial-up internet connection a lot more frequently (for no reason except my love for them, of course).

After years of nagging my mum buys a computer. I find Sal's Realm of Runescape, an online fansite with a forum which I spent increasing amounts of time on. They had a graphics forum where people make cool forum signatures. I want in on this, so I splash three years' worth of my weekly allowance to buy an entirely legal copy of Adobe速 Photoshop速 and start [creating graphics using Adobe速 Photoshop速 software](https://www.adobe.com/uk/legal/permissions/trademarks.html). I spend a lot of time on it and it quickly becomes a hobby.
