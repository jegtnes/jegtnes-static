I start working with the lovely small dev team at Delib to help them upgrade their internal design system, dlb-public-ui, and two of their flagship products relying on it. The design system had several dependencies that hadn't been upgraded in several years, and the newer upgrades had a significant amount of breaking changes. Fortunately, Delib had the most comprehensive visual diff testing I've ever worked with, and between me and Delib's excellent QA engineer and the lead engineer, we worked out changes what were false positives, and worked to get the rest to within near-imperceptible levels.
