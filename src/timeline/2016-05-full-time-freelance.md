It seems like a large proportion of freelancers don't get into it by choice, but are forced into it by circumstances and accidentally enjoy it.

Anyways, redundancies hit cxpartners and I find myself unemployed and went through a number of damp job interview squibs, and an exciting freelance opportunity lands in my lap not too much later. Fate, eh?
