<h1 class="f1 f-subheadline-ns tracked-tight ttu ma0">Hello, world!</h1>

<p class="f3">I'm Alex, a freelance full-stack web developer in Vancouver, BC. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</p>

<p class="f3">It's nice to meet you. I make prototypes, pattern libraries, websites, and webapps that run fast, work well, and solve real user problems.</p>

<p class="f4">I'm available for hire from <strong>2nd January 2019</strong>, for projects in Vancouver or remote.</p>

<div class="measure lh-copy f4">

  <p>I'm infinitely curious about every aspect of the technologies that power the modern web. These days I mostly write full-stack JavaScript, but can comfortably wrangle PHP, Ruby, and MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB into submission in a more front-end focused role.</p>

  <p>That being said, I firmly believe we make better things by focusing on design and people over tech for tech's sake; especially as building software requires you to make hundreds of micro-decisions about the user experience in any given day. While I don't consider myself a designer, I'm pretty good at these decisions, having worked with fantastic designers in order to hoover up their knowledge. I can take an existing design direction and work with it without butchering it or having to bother actual designers every five seconds for feedback. I think that's worth something.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, I have a relentless drive to make things better. If you do, too, let's talk!</p>
