title: Moving to the UK

I move to the UK precisely two days after my high school graduation, callously breaking my poor mum's heart in the process (it's okay, she's forgiven my youthful follies since), taking a year off education to decide what I want to do with my life. I work part-time in a remote Scottish youth hostel and learn just how savage British school groups can be.
