In 2015 I delivered a talk on popular JavaScript build tools at the long-standing reputable online conference [CSSSummit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/css-summit/) and at the [Bristol JS meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/events/209519022/).

This talk covered the current state of build tools in the JavaScript world, comparing Broccoli, Gulp, and Grunt; as well as demonstrating some advanced build tools techniques live, including automatically generating responsive images and responsive images markup, and outputting critical path CSS.

Unfortunately the talk wasn't recorded, but you can [view the slides here](http://static.jegtnes.co.uk/talks/2015-07-csssummit) and [see the demos on GitHub](https://github.com/jegtnes/gulping-your-broccoli).
