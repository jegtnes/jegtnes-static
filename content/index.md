<h1 class="f-subheadline tracked-tight ttu mb1">Hello, world.</h1>

<p class="f3">I'm Alex, a full-stack web developer in Bristol, UK.</p>

I'm infinitely curious about every aspect of the technologies that power modern websites and web applications, but more importantly, about the people that use them. I believe we make better things by focusing on design and people over tech for tech's sake.

I specialise in front-end performance optimisation, pattern libraries, and helping businesses run smoother by doing everything in my power to strike the perfect balance between design, performance, and re-usability.
