<h1 class="f-subheadline tracked-tight ttu mb1 mt1">Hello, world.</h1>

<p class="f3">I'm Alex, a freelance full-stack web developer in Bristol, UK.</p>

<div class="measure lh-copy f4">

<p>I'm infinitely curious about every aspect of the technologies that power modern websites and web applications, but more importantly, about the people that use them. I believe we make better things by focusing on design and people over tech for tech's sake.</p>

<p>Some of the things I specialise in are front-end performance optimisation, user-centred rapid prototyping, pattern libraries, and helping businesses run smoother by striking the balance between design, performance, and re-usability.</p>

<p>I'm at my most comfortable when dealing with full-stack JavaScript, but I can comfortably wrangle PHP, Ruby, and MySQL/Postgres into submission in a more client-side-focused role.</p>

<p>Currently I'm looking for work from **September**. I'm primarily looking for short-to-medium term contracting opportunities in Bristol or remote, but if you've got a particularly exciting full-time remote position I'd love to hear from you too.</p>

<p>Shall we talk?</p>
