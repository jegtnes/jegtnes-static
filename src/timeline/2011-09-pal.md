Second year rolls around and I become a student rep for my course, as well as a [Peer Assisted Learning leader](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/study-support/peer-assisted-learning)â€”basically I put on an open-ended study session every week for a specific module I had in first year. This was a really great experience and reinforced my beliefs that one of the best ways to master something is to teach it to others. The module I was assisting with, Introduction to Web Design, was taken by quite a few other creative courses who had otherwise no background or experience with the web, and I had to go back to basics. It was really satisfying when you saw that a concept _clicked_ with students because of your help.
