<h1 class="f-subheadline tracked-tight ttu ma0">Hello, world.</h1>

<p class="f3">I'm Alex, a freelance full-stack web developer in Bristol, UK. I make prototypes, pattern libraries, websites, and webapps that run fast, work well, and solve real user problems.</p>

<div class="measure lh-copy f4">

<p>Currently I'm looking for remote contracting opportunities from the **19th September**; or if you're based in/near Bristol I'm happy to work from your office (psst: I wouldn't be at all opposed to an exciting full-time remote gig, as well).</p>

<p>I'm infinitely curious about every aspect of the technologies that power modern websites and web applications, but more importantly, about the people that use them. I believe we make better things by focusing on design and people over tech for tech's sake.</p>

<p>I'm at my most comfortable when dealing with full-stack JavaScript, but I can comfortably wrangle PHP, Ruby, and MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB into submission in a more client-side-focused role.</p>

<p>Shall we talk?</p>
