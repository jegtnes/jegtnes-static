I join [Simpleweb](https://simpleweb.com), a Bristol web development agency, as a uni placement web developer. This was a really fun experience, I worked with some very talented creative developers, and I get my first direct experience with agency work. I mostly worked with WordPress, PHP, and jQuery for client projects, but also got some experience with Ruby on Rails by building an internal HR tool.
