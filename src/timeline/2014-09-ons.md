One of my first projects at cxpartners is working with the Office for National Statistics: they had an ambitious project going to entirely rebuild their site using the GDS model, and they hire cxpartners to do help with user research and help build out a [pattern library](https://onsdigital.github.io/pattern-library/) for the [alpha version of their new website](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2014/12/08/ons-website-prototype-launches/). 

Working on such a big and impactful project so early on in my career was fantastic: not only did I enjoy helping to deliver the alpha ONS pattern library as a junior developer; but getting to work together with some very talented experience designers and user researchers was a privilege and helped me grow as a developer in many ways.

I go to Barcelona with the small cxpartners dev team to attend the [Velocity] conference.
