A new project is on the horizon: cxpartners form a multidisciplinary team to work with coop@home, one of Switzerland's largest online grocery retailers. Once again, I got deeply involved in the user-centred design process and loved every minute. It was really difficult work, and _many_ post-its were sacrificed, but we solved a lot of problems, and the coop@home website is still, nine years later, in my unbiased opinion, better than most UK supermarkets'. All websites are, of course, more or less Theseus' ~~ships~~ websites, but it's neat that what we designed and built worked so well that their fundamentals are still there nine years later at the time of writing.

[The cxpartners case study](https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/our-work/coop-supermarket/) has some more details.
