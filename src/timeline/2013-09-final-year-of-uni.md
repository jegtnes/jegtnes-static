Emboldened by a successful and enjoyable placement year at Simpleweb, I return to university for my final year of studies. Having lived long enough in the UK to be baffled at the state of the trains, I decide to make a train journey planning website for my final year project/dissertation, frustrated at how there are more than 20 different train operating companies in the UK, but their websites were all reskins of the same two booking engines, which were horrendous on both the UI and UX front.
