<p>So, here we go. After much mulling, a fair bit of indecisiveness, an existential crisis or two, and a wholesome dose of procrastination, I have finally launched my new site. It also has a blog, as you may have figured.</p>

<h2>17-year old Alex would probably not return the emails of 21-year old Alex.</h2>
<p>For a very long time, I had convinced myself that I was never a person to blog about anything â€“ mostly because I didn't think I was 'clever' enough, and I had a fear that mean people on the internet would laugh at me; but I simultaneously thought nobody would read it, and thus, rendering the entire blogging exercise quite pointless. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. I know. I wasn't too bright.</p>
<p>So, here goes nothing. This will be an interesting experiment, for sure. If it turns out that 17-year old Alex was right and I end up having a bunch of people laugh at me because my posts are terrible, so be it. If it turns out 17-year old Alex was right and nobody will ever read this, so be it.</p>
<h2>Speaking of no visitors,</h2>
The lovely <a href="http://markjs.net">Mark</a> has convinced me that Google Analytics is apparently inferior to this new fancy analytics tool called <a href="http://gosquared.com">GoSquared</a>. I'll be installing this and giving it a try. Maybe that'd make for an interesting blog post. Using GoSquared will hopefully allow me to find out whether it is with more ease than my trusty old pal Google Analytics.<p></p>

<p>Looks like I'm starting to ramble on, and I better stop writing here before I embarrass myself further. Isn't part of being a good writer to know when to stop? <small>It probably isn't, and now I'm just starting to dig the proverbial hole deeper.</small></p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to ignore me and/or throw vitriolic abuse at me in the comment section below.</p>
