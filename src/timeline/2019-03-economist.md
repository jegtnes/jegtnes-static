After my working holiday visa expires, I move back to the UK and decide to give London a try. I was put in touch with the lovely bunch at [Orangejellyfish](https://www.orangejellyfish.com/), who were providing technical consultancy to The Economist.

The Economist were in the process of re-building their website and I initially joined the team responsible for maintaining the existing site, and the occasional smattering of new features or custom-designed story collections. Over time, as more people moved over to the team making the new website, I was the only person responsible for the front-end of the Economist.

Eventually, as momentum shifted, the existing site had a feature freeze put on it and I moved over to help with building the new site, which was a server-rendered React/Next application, increasingly backed by a design system which was being worked on in tandem.
