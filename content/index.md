# Hello world
I'm infinitely curious and love learning about every aspect of the technologies that power modern websites and web applications, but more importantly, about the people that use them. I believe we make better things by focusing on design and people over tech for tech's sake.

I specialise in front-end performance optimisation, pattern libraries, and helping businesses run smoother by doing everything in my power to strike the perfect balance between design, performance, re-usability, and meeting business goals.
