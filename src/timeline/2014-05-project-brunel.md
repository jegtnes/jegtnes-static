title: Final year project completion

For my final year project, I wanted to explore ranking complex train journeys by _quality_ instead of a simple list of departures sorted by departure time, and choose three user-weighted metrics instead: price, journey time, and amount of changes required. Depending on user needs, you may prefer, for example, a much slower train journey with one change instead of a quicker and more expensive journey with two changes, or vice-versa. It was very satisfying to work on, especially as it scratched a personal itch, and had it not continuously broken because it relied on screen scraping to fetch the data (look, the alternative at the time was a horrendous SOAP API with no free tier for educational use), it'd have been a very fun side project to maintain. I built it using Rails (and not because of the thematic appropriateness), and it won the Best Digital Media Project award at the faculty awards, so I, too, can call myself an award-winning developer, which was all the rage in the early-mid 2010s.

I dip my second toe in the freelance waters by creating a WordPress plugin for a uni friend's client website. The water was fine!
