title: Attending my first web development conference
date: 2009-10-01

Bristol's iconic web development conference, [WebDevConf](https://webdevconf.com/), is hosted at my university, and our course lead arranged for us all to get free tickets. Figuring it'd probably be more fun than a day of lectures, I go, and unexpectedly have a really great time (turns out most conference speakers are more interesting than many of our lecturers) and decide to return next year.

I have since attended every WDC that's been put on except one, and even spoke at it in 2022 (insert link here).
