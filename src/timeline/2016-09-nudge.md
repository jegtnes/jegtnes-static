For my second contracting engagement, I join the friendly people at [Nudge Digital](https://web.archive.org/web/20170728034747/http://www.nudgedigital.co.uk/) (who have since been acquired) - building and maintaining WordPress and Drupal sites for several of their clients. I befriend senior dev [Ben Organ](https://twitter.com/benorgan) and we bond over how we want to move to Canada following The 2016 Vote That Shall Not Be Namedâ„¢, and how much of a good boy his cat Stannis is.
