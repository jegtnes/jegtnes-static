At cxpartners we get involved with the [Institute of Mechanical Engineering](https://imeche.org) to redesign their website using a pattern-library-led approach. We spread the good word of breaking down silos, bringing devs and designers together earlier, and save ourselves a bunch of time down the road by combining forces sooner. A fun example of some of the forward-thinking stuff we were up to is [detailed in this blog post by James Chudley](https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/our-thinking/how-to-run-a-user-centred-photoshoot/) about content photography suitable to all breakpoints of our responsive redesign.
