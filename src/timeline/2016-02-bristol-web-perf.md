I start a Bristol meetup with the eminent [Stu Charlton](https://twitter.com/stuccharlton) and [Drew McLellan](https://allinthehead.com/about), all about web performance, imaginatively named Bristol Web Performance. 

Over time, we realise that this town (Bristol) isn't big enough for a monthly meetup about web performance, but we still manage to host nine excellent meetups, featuring excellent speakers such as [Yoav Weiss](https://blog.yoav.ws/), [Bruce Lawson](https://brucelawson.co.uk/), [Ruth John](https://ruthjohn.com/), [Andy Davies](https://andydavies.me/), [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/), [Matt Jukes](https://www.jukes.ie/), and many others. I really loved the community-building aspect of it, got to [practice my copywriting](https://twitter.com/kasiazien/status/785804310739230720/photo/1), and was not lying when I said I'd [make people cocktails](https://twitter.com/Rumyra/status/789160239299956736/photo/1) on request ([such as a White Lady](https://twitter.com/Rumyra/status/789162564462665729), one of my [personal favourites](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/2091/white-lady)). We also had [bubble teas](https://twitter.com/jegtnes/status/700038774185730048) courtesy of [Nichole](https://nichole.is/), and vegan catering before it was cool.
