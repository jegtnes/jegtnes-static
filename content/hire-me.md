# Hire me

Hi there! I'm Alex, a freelance web developer in Vancouver, BC.

I'm available for hire for projects starting the 10th January, either remote, or Vancouver-based.

I have five years of professional experience creating usable, fast, and accessible websites, web apps, pattern libraries, and prototypes. I'm a hybrid at heart and firmly believe that the more and earlier we collaborate, the better products we make.

In particular, I've spent a lot of time working with fantastic designers, on all stages of a project—from early-stage rapid prototyping to slower, larger projects, which has taught me possibly as much, if not more, than working with developers. While I don't consider myself a designer, I'm great at taking an existing design decision and working with it, as well as collaborating with designers to ensure new design directions can be implemented in a performant, accessibly-minded, scalable manner.

Earlier in my career, I specialised in accessibility, pattern libraries, scalable (S)CSS, and prototyping, and in the last couple of years, I've sharpened my web performance and JavaScript-related skills a signficant amount, and I'm comfortable using Typescript, React, Node, Webpack, and Gulp/Grunt.

As you can probably tell from the above, I'm more of a front-end than a back-end developer, but I have some knowledge of PHP, Ruby, MySQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and general-purpose server administration things. They're not my main areas of focus, to be entirely honest, but I can work with them, and I'm comfortable enough working in most templating languages.

Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to publicly talk about most of my recent work, but some of my recent clients include cxpartners, Lovehoney, Nudge Digital, and Nationwide Building Society.

If I sound like I could be a good fit for your team or someone you know, I'd love to have a chat! My email is alex@jegtnes.com.

In any case, thanks for reading, and have a wonderful day. ✨
