For my first grown-up, full-time contracting gig, I join Nationwide as part of an external team to help them set up an in-house design studio, deliberately at arms' length from the main business to help them deliver excellent and innovative customer experiences quicker and cheaper.

This was a design- and UX-heavy setup, and I was one of two developers. I led development on a rapid prototype built in React, *Healthcheck*, to be used on an iPad in Nationwide branches as part of a conversation between customers and staff about customers' finances, which was well received by both customers and branch staff.
