(Alternative title: _12 Life Changing Twitter Hacks To Revolutionise Your Twitter Experience_)

If you, like I, have seen one or two too many clickbait impression-farming 'viral' articles shared on the internet, and if you, too, use Tweetbot (_alternative clients for your favourite social media sites that support regular expressions are available)_ , my procrastination has a gift for you.

[Antiviral](https://gist.github.com/jegtnes/9187879) is a list of Tweetbot mute filters to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of your Twitter stream, heavily inspired by [@snipeyhead](https://twitter.com/snipeyhead)'s [Downworthy](http://downworthy.snipe.net/) browser plugin.

While I entirely realise that high-quality content can hide behind clickbait titles; far too often I give it the benefit of the doubt. I just decided to share something that makes my life a tiny bit better. If you can use this as well, I'm delighted. :)
