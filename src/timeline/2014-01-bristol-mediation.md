One of the more interesting modules was a group-based one that my course shared with IT Management for Business students, where our final project was working with local Bristol charities to help them identify and solve business problems. My group was partnered up with [Bristol Mediation (now known as Resolve West)](https://resolvewest.org/) and delivered a PHP-based internal web application for their volunteer mediators to share their availability and transport modality, to allow the organisers of the mediation sessions to pick the most sensible combination of mediators to people in need of their services.
