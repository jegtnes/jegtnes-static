I join cxpartners to help out on a project they were doing for the insurance company Zurich.

Through user research, they discovered Zurich salespeople relied a lot on printed literature to sell their products, which was cumbersome, frequently went out of date, and each document often had several unrelated sections, getting in the way of the conversation between customer and salesperson. 

I joined a small interdisciplinary team with designers, researchers, and another developer to prototype possible solutions and in a short, focused alpha phase, we released an alpha version of a custom digital document creation tool in three weeks, tested and validated this with users, got great feedback, and expanded upon this to create a fully-featured beta version that was known as ZDocs, a React-based web application designed to primarily run on iPads as a progressive web app.
