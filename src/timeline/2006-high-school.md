In the Norwegian school system, at the secondary level you can either choose general studies or a more specialised field; I chose _Media and Communications_, which covered all sorts of creative production at a base level, including photography, cinematography, graphic design, print design, video editing, journalism, Flash, (which was the style at the time), and web design. I initially decided on this course on account of my passion for photography and graphic design [insert meme here] at the time.
