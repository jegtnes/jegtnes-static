Two of my great friends, Zach and Laura, were putting on the third edition of their conference, HybridConf, in Berlin. My lightning talk proposal about the science behind habits, _Habitually Speaking_, was accepted, and I was scheduled as the first lightning talk of the day; but because of technical issues with the projector, I volunteered to go first to distract as my talk didn't _need_ the slides. Fortunately, the tech team fixed the projector halfway through it!

And that's the story of how I accidentally keynoted a conference with a lightning talk.
