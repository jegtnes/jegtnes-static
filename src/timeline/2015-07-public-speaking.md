I dip my toe into public speaking for the first time and deliver two talks:

### Post-preprocessing: When using Sass _isn't_ the best solution
A talk at the [SassXSW meetup in Bath](https://web.archive.org/web/20151225034355/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sassxsw-meet-up-bath-tickets-17260042251) about how Sass is great, but some of its features have a high risk of auto-foot-shooting, and where caution should be exercised when using them.

### Gulping your Broccoli
A talk at the remote conference [CSS Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150702084011/http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/css-summit/) comparing the state of different build tools at the time (it was very clever, you see, because back in the day, "Gulp" and "Broccoli" were two well-known build tools) and how to implement various common features in each of them, including BrowserSync, responsive image generation, reducing compilation time with Broccoli, CSS injection, and critical path CSS generation.
