I take a part-time job for beer money as an English to Norwegian translator at [FreestyleXtreme](https://web.archive.org/web/20120502114651/http://www.freestylextreme.com/), who were an extreme sports apparel e-commerce store. (They were genuinely a lovely bunch and I'm sad to see [they were a Brexit casualty](https://cyclingindustry.news/freestyle-extreme-ceases-trading-seemingly-blaming-brexit/).) During their busiest times of the year I took care of various other duties when required, such as warehouse fulfilment, returns processing, and customer service.

Once my line manager realises that I know how to make websites I was quickly re-assigned to making a few quick WordPress and Magento sites to support some of the biggest brands they were stocking and direct more traffic to their main site, and I developed a plugin to automatically convert a Google Products XML feed to a widget. This was the first time somebody paid me money to make websites and I was chuffed. I stay with FreestyleXtreme for a year and a half until I start my uni placement.
