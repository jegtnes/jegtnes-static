I decided to study some sort of web design or web development, because that seemed like an exciting field that had decent employment prospects compared to my other love, photography. My open day in Bristol was on a perfect, gorgeous spring day and I instantly fell in love with Bristol, and move there to start a BSc in Web Design at UWE Bristol.

The photo is related, as my first project in one of my modules, Interaction Design, is to redesign a board game, so we had to play extensive amounts of Cluedo for research.
